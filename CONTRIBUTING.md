## 📝 How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

If you find a bug, please create an issue with:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Bot logs if available
- Your environment (Railway, local, etc.)

### Feature Requests

For new features:
- Check existing issues first
- Describe the use case clearly
- Explain how it benefits the HLL community
- Consider implementation complexity

### Code Contributions

1. **Keep it focused:** One feature/fix per pull request
2. **Follow the existing style:** Use the same patterns as the current code
3. **Test thoroughly:** Make sure your changes work in different scenarios
4. **Update documentation:** Add/update comments and README if needed

## 🏗️ Code Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and not too long

### Discord Bot Best Practices
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use ephemeral responses for error messages
- Provide clear user feedback
- Don't spam the console with debug messages

### CRCON Integration
- Handle connection failures gracefully
- Add timeouts to all requests
- Log important events
- Don't assume CRCON data format

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing
1. Set up a test Discord server
2. Use a test CRCON instance or mock the responses
3. Test all bot commands and edge cases
4. Verify Railway deployment works

### Test Scenarios
- Bot startup with missing environment variables
- CRCON connection failures
- Discord permission issues
- Auto-switch functionality
- Match end detection
- Time tracking accuracy

## 📦 Deployment

### Railway Compatibility
- Ensure your changes work on Railway
- Test environment variable handling
- Check that logs are visible in Railway dashboard
- Verify restart behavior

### Environment Variables
- Add new variables to `.env.template`
- Update documentation
- Provide sensible defaults
- Validate required variables on startup

## 🐛 Debugging

### Common Issues
- **CRCON API changes:** Game updates may change API responses
- **Discord API limits:** Be mindful of rate limits
- **Time zone handling:** Always use UTC for consistency
- **Memory usage:** Bot should be lightweight for Railway

### Logging
- Use appropriate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Log important events but avoid spam
- Include context in error messages
- Don't log sensitive information (tokens, API keys)

## 📋 Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you change functionality
2. **Add environment variables** to the template if needed
3. **Test on Railway** or provide testing instructions
4. **Write clear commit messages** describing what and why
5. **Fill out the PR template** completely

### PR Checklist
- [ ] Code follows the style guidelines
- [ ] Changes are tested locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Environment template is updated if needed
- [ ] No sensitive data is committed
- [ ] Railway deployment works (if applicable)
